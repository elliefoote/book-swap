## About The Project

It can be difficult to get books in English in Barcelona, especially if you prefer to shop local. Using this app, readers can swap books in English, rather than taking up more space in their tiny apartments!

## Technologies Used

* Front end built with [React.js](https://reactjs.org/) and [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
* Back end built with [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
